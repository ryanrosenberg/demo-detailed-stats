The \"lottery model\" shows the tradeoff between this process and colonization. The result of this process is predicted by Tilman's R* (\"R-star\") rule. The Ricker model, which generalizes the Beverton-Holt model, models the \"scramble\" form of this process. A theory of this process was refuted by the paradox of the plankton. E.O. Wilson showed that this process causes character displacement, which can also cause intraguild predation. Gause predicted that species cannot coexist if they share the same ecological niche, called this process's \"exclusion principle\".

When this property holds for an adiabatic fluid, the Laplacian term vanishes from the Navier-Stokes equations, which thus reduce to the Euler (OIL-er) equations.
